# BattleScripts

BattleScripts is a turn-based educational game developed to be ran in Tūhura Tech sessions! Students will write a script in python to act out a strategy, and compete against other scripts.

The game is based on the iterated prisoner's dillemma, a thought experiment in regards to if one should act in self interest or mutual benefit. In this game, players can either choose to steal from the other player or support the other player over many turns.

BattleScripts will run on the Lead Mentor's laptop and be played on a big screen. Students will work on their scripts on their own laptops and turn in their .py files to compete.

Students that do this excersize should become more familiar with the concept of functions, returning variables, storing variables, getting data, and conditional statements. They should also gain a better understanding of writing pseudocode, and planning in advance.



## script_template

script_template.py is a template for the students battlescript that they will submit. It includes some functions and variables by default for them to fill out. The main function is run each turn.
